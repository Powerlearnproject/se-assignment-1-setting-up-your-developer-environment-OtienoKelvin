1. Downloading and installing Windows 11.

My PC did not meet the meanimum system requirement for Windows 11 as per the Microsoft guideline on installation of Windows 11.
So I had to adjust some changes in my Regisry editor as Microsoft recommended for people whose PC did not meet the minimum system requirement for Windows 11.

In my Regisry editor Inavigated to: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup  and added a regisry by the name, type and value as shown below.

Name: AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU

Type: REG_DWORD

Value: 1

After downloading Windows 11 Disk Image (ISO) for x64 devices, I located the file in File Explorer, right cklicked it and mount it to begin Windows 11 setup.
